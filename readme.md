# OCD - OfflineCodeTester
An offline alternative to [SimpleCodeTester](https://github.com/I-Al-Istannen/SimpleCodeTester) for everyone who is too afraid to write an E-Mail.

## Rust > Java
SimpleCodeTester is written in Java hence being very slow.
OfflineCodeTester is written in Rust hence being very fast.

## OCD is experimental
OCD is just a little side project and in a medium finished state.
It works but is by no means bugfree.

### Known issues
- Several crashes regarding empty interaction folders or non-existing paths
- Running in non-multithread mode
- Running on Windows? (didn't test it there, would be strange if everything worked out of the box)
